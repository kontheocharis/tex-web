        <p>When \(\partial A \; \partial 0 \; \partial N \; \partial S\) there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are:</p>
        <p>$$ \hat{E}\psi(x,t) = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x} \psi(x,t) + V(x,t)\psi (x,t) $$</p>

        <p>A paragraph with an inline equation: \(s = \frac{100}{9.58} = 10.43841336\). Notice how the fraction has been scaled down, so that it fits within a line of text. Even complicsted equations work quite well. \(x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}\) still fits in the paragraph. Sort of. In the old days of printing, fonts were made of metal and were literally one to a size. The characters in a font for the body text of a book would look noticeably different to that same font at a larger size for titling. Nowadays, computer-based fonts can be scaled linearly to any size imaginable, but well designed fonts are still made available with variations based on the intended size of the output. In brief, the smaller a font is, the less fine its intricacies must be in order to survive the transfer from (possibly imperfect) printed page or low-resolution screen to eye. Conversely, a font designed to be large can be more delicately rendered. For the original Computer Modern fonts, designed in METAFONT, the optical</p>

        <p>And a block equation: $$s = \frac{100}{9.58} = 10.43841336$$ \(s = \frac{100}{9.58} = 10.43841336\)</p>

        <p>Styling for long numbers should be done with MathJax too. If you want commas in long numbers, adding them manually would result in unwanted spaces e.g. \(100,000,000\). one way around this is to enclose the commas in curly brackets - \( \{{,}\} \implies 100{,}000{,}000\)</p>
